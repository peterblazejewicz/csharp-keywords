# csharp-keywords

C# keywords: reserved identifiers, contextual keywords as a single, meaningful and executable C# program to help with your learning process.

## So, what are reserved keywords

> Keywords are predefined, reserved identifiers that have special meanings to the compiler. They cannot be used as identifiers in your program unless they include `@` as a prefix. For example, `@if` is a valid identifier, but `if` is not because `if` is a keyword.
